# Nanoprocessor-Design-Project
The assigned laboratory task encompasses creating a 4-bit nano processor capable of executing a basic set of instructions. This involves developing various components such as an Add/Subtract unit, a Program Counter, multiplexers, a Register Bank, an Instruction Decoder, and a Program ROM. The goal is to implement the provided instruction set and construct a functional nanoprocessor circuit.
